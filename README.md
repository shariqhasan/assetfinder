# assetfinder

Find domains and subdomains potentially related to a given domain.


## Install

If you have Go installed and configured (i.e. with `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`):

```
go install github.com/cybercdh/assetfinder@cybercdh
```

Otherwise [download a release for your platform](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder/releases).
To make it easier to execute you can put the binary in your `$PATH`.

## Usage
